    <p>SGMC Health earned recognition at the Georgia Hospital Association (GHA) Patient Safety Summit, receiving second and third place Josh Nahum Awards for their Infection Prevention and Control projects.</p>

    <p>The second-place project, "Discharge Antibiotics Optimization for Urinary Tract Infections in Emergency Room Patients," developed an antibiogram to help emergency department physicians select more effective empiric antibiotics for UTI treatment. By analyzing local population data, the team created evidence-based treatment guidelines to reduce ineffective prescriptions.</p>

    <p>The third-place "Antimicrobial Stewardship Team for Better Clinical Outcomes" project focuses on optimizing antimicrobial use. The team meets quarterly to evaluate prescription practices, ensuring appropriate medication selection, dosing, and treatment duration while minimizing side effects. These efforts improve patient outcomes, prevent drug resistance, and reduce costs.</p>

  author: Hala Sharma, MD PGY-2
  content: >
    <p>Amidst the hustle and bustle of residency, never-ending labs, vitals, nursing requests, seminars, and lengthy note-writing, the bigger picture may become obscured. The why can fall to the wayside while working through the details and minutiae. My most important realization during my intern year while learning what to do was remembering why I was doing it. I wanted to learn and become more efficient and interpreting labs, remembering medications, and improving my presentations during rounds. Yet, some moments would ground and swing me back to reality.</p>

    <p>I would walk into the room of my patient and see the scared, confused pained look in their eyes as they tried to observe the myriad of medical information hurtling their way. Their lives were about to change or transform before my eyes. In times like this, I needed to stop and take a breath as well. This was my eighth patient, but it was their whole world. I would need to remind myself to sit down and give this person, who has a whole life outside of this room, the moment they needed to understand and tell me how they felt. They needed to be heard. Sometimes I felt helpless and confused because I did not have many of the answers to their questions immediately. Or perhaps at other moments, I lacked the confidence to clarify their confusion. This would become my splash of cold-water clarity that there was a human life sitting before me. This was not a textbook module or an exam question I could repeat if I was wrong. Thankfully, I observed humanistic qualities among my peers and sought advice from great mentors. I recalled times when I was the person sitting on the bed waiting for a doctor to come by to answer all my questions and reassure me from my fears. The waiting is painful and terrifying when sick and in pain. There is the hope that this suffering will be temporary and will end. This requires trust in those caring for you. In my day, this may mean spending an extra ten minutes in a patient room talking with them but for them, it will shape the rest of their day.</p>

    <p>Another important realization that washed over me was how much of a team effort it is to care for a patient. So many cogs are required to run this machine, which becomes painfully noticeable when one is not working. The nucleus of each is the patient. This line of work requires a lot of patience and emotional maturity. Learning this is an integral part of our training. It is not necessarily perfection that is the goal of medicine but the ability to learn and adapt. At the heart of the matter is kindness and empathy for the suffering and patience when it may be the hardest to give.</p>

    <p>In the heart of West Africa lies Ghana‚Äîa vibrant nation that shed its colonial name "the Gold Coast" upon gaining independence in 1957. From the bustling streets of coastal Accra to the storied palaces of Ashanti kingdoms, this land pulses with a cultural tapestry woven from over 100 ethnic groups, colorful festivals, and time-honored traditions that breathe life into every corner of this enchanting country..</p>

    <p><i>"∆ête s…õn?",</i> (How are you?) is the melodious greeting that floats through the air, where life moves to the rhythm of dunun drums and basks in the warmth of endless summer sun. In Ghana's bustling capital Accra, multiple languages create a beautiful symphony - English weaves through rapid-fire Twi (the most widely spoken Akan language), melodious Ga, and rhythmic Ewe, while the aroma of jollof rice (claimed by Ghanaians as the world's finest!) drifts from local chop bars to meet the salty breeze from the Gulf of Guinea.</p>

    </div>

    <p>We are a people who speak with both words and cloth - our traditional kente fabric, originally worn by Ashanti royalty, tells stories through its intricate patterns. The <i>Adwinasa</i> pattern, meaning "all motifs are exhausted," represents excellence and creativity. When you hear someone say <i>Medaase</i> (thank you), it's often accompanied by a slight bow and sometimes followed by <i>∆êy…õ</i> (It is good) - small gestures that speak volumes about our culture of respect and gratitude.</p>

    <p>At the legendary Makola Market, traders balance vibrant baskets with remarkable grace, their calls of <i>"Bra b…õfa!"</i> (Come and buy!) mixing with friendly haggling and laughter. Market women, respectfully addressed as "Mama," display everything from garden-fresh vegetables to the spectacular kente cloth. The Adwinasa pattern of kente, meaning "all motifs are exhausted," tells stories of excellence through its intricate designs, each thread woven with history.</p>

    <p>In the evening, as the sun paints the sky over Lake Volta, children's laughter rings out during games of ampe, their joy infectious. Cape Coast Castle, standing stark white against the blue horizon, tells powerful stories of the past, while Labadi Beach pulses with modern highlife music and the tempting aroma of grilled tilapia.</p>

    <p>The Ghanaian handshake, known as <i>"F…õw,"</i> captures the spirit of this magical land - starting formal, warming to casual, and ending with a playful finger snap. When someone offers a heartfelt <i>"Wo ho ye f…õ"</i> (You're beautiful/handsome), the proper response is <i>"Wo nso"</i> (You too) - a small but meaningful exchange that exemplifies Ghanaian charm.</p>

    <p>In the cool of the evening, when calls of <i>"Me k…î da"</i> (I'm going to sleep) signal day's end, the magic of Ghana lingers like a sweet aftertaste of ripe pineapple. Here, strangers become family, and time slows to the peaceful pace of <i>"B…îk…î…î"</i> (Take it easy) - not just a phrase, but the very heartbeat of Ghanaian life.</p>

    <p><i>"Me da wo ase!"</i> (Thank you!) for experiencing this glimpse into a land where coastal rhythms blend with palace drums, where a hundred cultures weave tomorrow's stories into the vibrant fabric of Ghana.</p>

    Burnout is a common challenge in residency that can affect both your well-being and patient care. Learning to recognize and address burnout early is crucial for a sustainable medical career:
    <p>Key warning signs of burnout include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Emotional exhaustion:</strong> Feeling drained after shifts, detached from patients.</li>
      <li> <strong>Physical fatigue:</strong> Trouble sleeping, frequent illnesses, persistent tiredness</li>
      <li> <strong>Mental fog:</strong> Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering details</li>
      <li> <strong>Loss of purpose:</strong> Questioning career choice or feeling cynical about medicine</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Practical steps to prevent burnout:</p>
      <li> <strong>Set boundaries:</strong> Stay in touch with family and friends outside medicine.</li>
      <li> <strong>Practice micro-breaks:</strong> Take short moments between patients to breathe and reset</li>
      <li> <strong>Seek support early:</strong> Talk to chief residents, mentors, or professional counselors</li>
      <li> <strong>Prioritize basics:</strong> Protect your sleep, exercise, and meal times</li>
    <br/>
    Remember: Taking care of yourself isn't selfish‚Äîit's essential for providing the best care to your patients. If you're struggling, reach out. You're not alone in this journey.
