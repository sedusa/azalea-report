subtitle: SGMC Health Internal Medicine Residency Newsletter
date: Edition 1, September 2024
welcome: Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Azalea Report, a resident-led e-newsletter for the Internal Medicine Residency program at South Georgia Health in Valdosta, Georgia. We chose the name "Azalea Report" to honor Valdosta's nickname as the "Azalea City," reflecting our aim to flourish and showcase the best of our program, much like the vibrant azaleas that bloom across our city each spring. In this first edition, we're excited to spotlight outstanding residents, share program achievements, and hear from our newly appointed Chief Residents about their plans for the coming year. We'll also feature a section on community engagement, highlighting how our residents contribute to Valdosta and surrounding areas. Whether you're a current resident, faculty member, prospective applicant, or simply interested in our program, we invite you to explore the Azalea Report and join us on this exciting journey of growth and excellence in medical education.

    The PAR tribal system aims to act as a liaison between residents and GME focusing on resident wellness, building camaraderie and improving the resident experience. The PAR resident body recently voted for Dr Ghida Akdhar as the new Vice President, with Dr Danhely Cruz continuing on as our president. We thank Dr Sheri Walls for all her hardwork and dedication in advocating for the resident body and improving the resident experience. 

    Dr Akdhar, a Lebanese national who studied medicine at The Universite Saint Joseph in Lebanon, is excited for her new role and is committed to the continued improvement of resident well-being. "I was always drawn to extracurricular activities where I can voice my opinion, advocate for change and develop my leadership skills. I don't believe that we have to be in any titled position to have a leading role in change, but I did want to be held accountable for my work, and that's why I decided to run for a leadership position in the Tribal Council. I really believe we can shape residency into what it's supposed to be, an enjoyable training experience that does not come at the cost of our well-being."
