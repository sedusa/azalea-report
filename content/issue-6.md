        Meet our Chief Resident, Dr. Mariya Tom, who brings the heart of Atlanta and a dancer's grace to our program. Her journey into medicine began with family—uncles and aunties whose tireless work in healthcare shaped her understanding of what it truly means to be a physician. Their stories of patient care and the fulfillment found in saving lives became the foundation of her medical calling.

        A trained professional Indian classical dancer with a passion for Zumba, Dr. Tom embodies the balance between artistic expression and clinical excellence. When she's not in the hospital, you'll find her traveling, reading, or back home in Atlanta with her husband and family, often recharging with her go-to comfort food of chicken and rice after long shifts.

        Dr. Tom's clinical interests center on endocrinology, with post-residency plans including fellowship training before returning to Atlanta to build both her practice and family life. Her guidance to incoming residents reflects hard-earned wisdom: "Give yourself grace. You'll make mistakes. Own them, learn from them, and forgive yourself. Progress, not perfection, is the goal."

        The advice that has anchored her own journey continues to shape her leadership: "Be the doctor you would want for your own family." This principle has kept her grounded and compassionate through the most challenging days, reminding her to communicate clearly, stay present, and care deeply for every patient. Dr. Tom's blend of clinical expertise, cultural richness, and artistic soul represents the multifaceted nature of healers who bring their whole selves to the art of caring for others.

        Meet Dr. Brandon Rockwell, our Chief Resident from Warner Robins, Georgia, who discovered his calling at the intersection of his fascination with the natural world and desire to help others thrive. Internal medicine represents the perfect convergence of intellectual curiosity and meaningful human connection, allowing him to channel his analytical nature into creating positive change in patients' lives.

        An avid sports enthusiast, Dr. Rockwell follows college athletics with passion while staying active through pickleball and regular gym sessions. His love for reading feeds his intellectual appetite, and he's developed a unique hobby of brewing his own kombucha. After demanding shifts, he unwinds with his favorite comfort meal: a hearty steak burrito loaded with queso.

        Dr. Rockwell's professional aspirations center on primary care, where he envisions building lasting relationships with patients and serving as their advocate throughout their healthcare journey. His philosophy for succeeding in residency is refreshingly straightforward: "Trust your gut. Diligence outlasts intelligence and talent." The guidance that has shaped his own path emphasizes embracing challenges: "If deciding between two things, the right answer is likely whichever is more work."

        Interestingly, if medicine hadn't captured his heart, Dr. Rockwell might have found himself in plumbing—a profession that, like medicine, requires problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the satisfaction of fixing what's broken. His practical mindset and dedication to helping others showcase the versatile spirit he brings to our residency program.

    <p>This year, SGMC Health had excellent representation at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition in Moultrie, Georgia. The Sunbelt Ag Expo is truly a spectacle to behold — rightfully crowned as "North America's Premier Farm Show." It's a melting pot of farmers, educators, policymakers, and ag-enthusiasts, all gathered to witness the latest innovations in agriculture. From cutting-edge technology demonstrations to the naming of the Southeastern Farmer of the Year, the expo is a celebration of all things agriculture.</p>
    
    <p>As part of the healthcare initiatives at this year's expo, SGMC Health residents delivered presentations on pertinent health topics. Drs. Ledford, Yakubu, Randhawa, and Akram represented our program, sharing their expertise with the agricultural community and contributing to the important work of bringing healthcare education to farmers and their families.</p>

        Miami raised with Pakistani roots running deep, she's fluent in multiple languages and even more fluent in staying connected — FaceTime with family is non-negotiable. This year's mission? Survive intern year and match into anesthesia, with her eyes on cardiac and critical care where the patients are the sickest and the stakes are highest. That's her kind of medicine. 🩺 If the stethoscope hadn't happened, she'd probably be running her own interior design business — she's got that eye for making spaces beautiful, and decorating is where her creative side really shines. Her sacred wind-down routine: light a candle 🕯️, throw on Bridgerton or a classic Bollywood film, and let the world slow down. Sometimes it's a Netflix binge of 'You', other times it's those comfort films her parents introduced her to.  When she actually gets time off, she's either hiking a new trail or meeting friends at their favorite restaurant — good company, good food, that's the formula. She's not big on small talk, but ask her about her dad and watch her light up. She could talk for hours, and honestly, you'd want to listen. Volleyball was her thing back in the day, and you can still catch that competitive energy when she's locked into a tough case or powering through a shift. Her ideal day? Trail in the morning, lunch with her crew, candle and a movie at night, with FaceTime calls sprinkled throughout to keep her people close. She's carving her path in medicine while keeping her heart rooted in family and faith. 💛

        Born in Germany with Kurdish roots, this future cardiologist somehow fits piano playing into his residency schedule — not your typical resident hobby, but he makes it work. He's laser-focused on matching into Cardiology, though his life philosophy is surprisingly zen. Just chill. Keep it balanced, stay grounded, don't overthink it. If medicine hadn't panned out, he's convinced politics would've been his calling—turns out he's got a real talent for the art of conversation and persuasion. Democracy's loss is cardiology's gain. After long hospital shifts, you'll find him cooking actual meals from scratch. It's therapeutic. Movies though? Hard pass. He's never been into them and he's fully committed to that stance at this point. His ideal evening off sounds wild—pulling an all-nighter exploring a big city. There's something about that 3 AM urban energy, the streets, the spontaneous moments that just hits different when everyone else is asleep. When he needs to reset, any sport will do. Hand him a ball and point him toward something active and that's his decompression method. ⚽🏀 Fair warning though—he's not into marathon phone conversations. They literally give him a headache, so he keeps communication concise. Quality over quantity. As for the deeper stuff like his stories, quirks, and what really makes him tick, he keeps that close. Some things are better discovered through actual conversation than spelled out online. Consider it an open invitation to be curious.✨

  title: A Mid-Year Reflection for Our Interns
  image: /img/intern-mid-year.jpeg
  author: Samuel Edusa, MD PGY-2
  content: >
    <p>Look how far you've come.</p>

    <p>Four months ago, I wrote to you about finding your footing—about those tentative first steps, the wobbles, and the falls that would teach you balance. Today, I'm writing to celebrate the progress you've made and to help you navigate what many call "intern winter" — that challenging middle stretch where the initial excitement has faded, but the finish line still feels distant.</p>

    <h3>You're No Longer Walking — You're Stepping Forward</h3>

    <p>Remember when Epic seemed like an impossible maze? Now you navigate it with muscle memory. Remember when every lab value required frantic Googling? Now you're recognizing patterns. Remember when a simple admission felt overwhelming? Now you're managing multiple complex patients with growing confidence.</p>

    <p>These aren't small victories — they're monumental shifts. The fact that you're aware of what you don't know shows you know enough to recognize the gaps. That's progress, not failure.</p>

    <h3>The Mid-Year Slump Is Real—And Normal</h3>

    <p>Right now, you might be feeling tired in a way that's different from those first exhausting months. The novelty has worn off. The adrenaline that fueled your early days has settled. You're deep enough to see how much you still don't know, but not far enough to feel like you've truly mastered anything.</p>

    <p>This is the hardest part—the middle ground between "I have no idea what I'm doing" and "I've got this." It's the place where imposter syndrome whispers loudest, where fatigue feels permanent, and where the path ahead still seems long.</p>

    <p>I want you to know: this is exactly where you're supposed to be. The mid-year slump doesn't mean you're failing. It means you're growing.</p>

    <h3>Reflecting on Your Growth</h3>

    <p>Think back to July. Remember that intern who needed help with every note, who hesitated before calling an attending, who second-guessed every decision? That person is still you, but transformed. You write notes faster now. You make clinical decisions with more confidence. You've learned when to call for help and when you can handle it yourself.</p>

    <p>You've helped manage codes. You've broken bad news. You've stayed calm when everything felt chaotic. You've built relationships with patients who now ask for you by name. You've earned the trust of nurses who've seen you grow. These aren't small accomplishments—they're evidence that you're becoming the physician you set out to be.</p>

    <h3>Building on Your Foundation</h3>

    <p>The remaining months aren't about starting over—they're about building. You've laid the foundation. Now it's time to construct the framework. Every rotation becomes an opportunity to deepen your knowledge. Every complex case becomes a chance to integrate what you've learned.</p>

    <p>This is when you'll start to see connections you missed before. That patient with the strange presentation? You'll remember a similar case from September. That medication interaction? You'll recall learning about it in November. The knowledge is stacking, compounding, becoming part of your clinical intuition.</p>

    <h3>Managing the Fatigue</h3>

    <p>Let's talk about the exhaustion. It's real. Four months of long hours, emotional weight, and constant learning takes a toll. Sustainable medicine isn't about never being tired—it's about recognizing when you need rest and giving yourself permission to take it.</p>

    <p>Your days off aren't optional extras—they're essential maintenance. That book you've been meaning to read? Read it. That friend you haven't seen? See them. That hobby you've abandoned? Pick it back up. Medicine is a marathon, and you're only at the halfway point. You need to pace yourself.</p>

    <h3>Questions Are Still Your Superpower</h3>

    <p>Don't let mid-year confidence make you hesitant to ask questions. The best residents aren't those who stop asking—they're those who ask better questions. As you grow, your inquiries should evolve from "What do I do?" to "Why do we do it this way?" from "Is this right?" to "What if we tried this?"</p>

    <p>Curiosity isn't a sign of weakness—it's the engine of expertise. Keep questioning. Keep learning. Keep that beginner's mind that makes every case a teaching opportunity.</p>

    <h3>You're Not Just Surviving—You're Thriving</h3>

    <p>We see you now: managing your list with efficiency, teaching medical students, supporting each other through difficult shifts. You're not just surviving intern year—you're actively shaping it into a transformative experience.</p>

    <p>Look around at your classmates. They've grown too. You're not the only one feeling the weight and seeing the progress. Lean on each other. Celebrate each other's wins. Support each other through the hard days. This journey is individual, but you don't have to walk it alone.</p>

    <h3>The Finish Line Is Closer Than It Feels</h3>

    <p>Eight months remain. Eight months to solidify everything you've learned. Eight months to build the confidence that will carry you into PGY-2. Eight months to finish what you started.</p>

    <p>But here's the thing—this isn't really about finishing. It's about continuing. Because when July comes and you become PGY-2s, you'll realize that intern year was just the first chapter. There's so much more learning ahead, more challenges to embrace, more growth to experience.</p>

    <h3>Our Continued Commitment</h3>

    <p>We're still here for you. The support hasn't changed just because you've grown. We're still celebrating your victories. We're still here to answer your questions. We're still invested in your success, now more than ever, because we've seen how much you've already achieved.</p>

    <p>As you enter the second half, remember: you've proven you can do hard things. You've shown resilience, dedication, and growth. You've earned your place here.</p>

    <h3>Moving Forward Together</h3>

    <p>So keep stepping forward. Keep asking questions. Keep learning. Keep caring. And most importantly, keep believing in the physician you're becoming—because we believe in you.</p>

    <p>You've made it almost halfway. You've got this. Now let's finish strong. 💪🏽</p>

    <p>In the basement classrooms of SGMC Health, an extraordinary cultural exchange unfolded as medical residents gathered for "Culturosity: Ghana vs. Nigeria," transforming a typical lunch hour into a vibrant celebration of West African heritage. The event, far from being a competition as its playful title might suggest, showcased the rich culinary traditions that bind these two influential African nations.</p>

    <p>The spread was a visual and aromatic testament to the depth of both cultures' cuisines. Traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian dishes filled the serving tables, from aromatic jollof rice displaying its characteristic orange-red hue to tender khebab skewers seasoned with complex spice blends. Plates of grilled chicken, prepared in distinctly different but equally mouthwatering styles, sat alongside pots of rich stews studded with fish and vegetables. The centerpiece was a variety of rice dishes, each telling its own story of regional preferences and cooking techniques.</p>

    </div>

    <p>But this gathering transcended the dining experience, evolving into a masterclass in cultural exchange. The event artfully wove together culinary traditions with deeper insights into West African heritage. While the aromas of spiced dishes filled the air, conversations flowed naturally between residents and students, bridging gaps in cultural understanding. The long-standing playful debate over jollof rice supremacy between Ghana and Nigeria sparked animated discussions, while first-time tastings of traditional dishes created moments of discovery and connection. Through these shared experiences, the medical community demonstrated how food can serve as a powerful catalyst for cultural appreciation and understanding.</p>

  altImageText: Emotional well-being
  image: /img/emotional-plushie.jpeg
  content: >
    <p>Those charming "Emotional Support" plushies you might have spotted scattered throughout our hospital corridors capture the often-unspoken reality of medical residency perfectly. These whimsical crochet creations, shaped like teacups with wisps of steam rising from their rims, hold a telling message: "It's fine, I'm fine. Everything is fine!"</p>

    <p>While these delightful companions make us smile, they also open an important dialogue about how we, as healthcare professionals, process stress and emotions. It's a gentle reminder that sometimes saying "I'm fine" three times doesn't make it true, and that's okay.</p>

    <p>Remember: Our residency program offers confidential counseling services and peer support groups. Taking care of yourself isn't just fine—it's essential.</p>
