        Meet our Chief Resident, Dr. Mariya Tom, who brings the heart of Atlanta and a dancer's grace to our program. Her journey into medicine began with family‚Äîuncles and aunties whose tireless work in healthcare shaped her understanding of what it truly means to be a physician. Their stories of patient care and the fulfillment found in saving lives became the foundation of her medical calling.

        A trained professional Indian classical dancer with a passion for Zumba, Dr. Tom embodies the balance between artistic expression and clinical excellence. When she's not in the hospital, you'll find her traveling, reading, or back home in Atlanta with her husband and family, often recharging with her go-to comfort food of chicken and rice after long shifts.

        Dr. Tom's clinical interests center on endocrinology, with post-residency plans including fellowship training before returning to Atlanta to build both her practice and family life. Her guidance to incoming residents reflects hard-earned wisdom: "Give yourself grace. You'll make mistakes. Own them, learn from them, and forgive yourself. Progress, not perfection, is the goal."

        The advice that has anchored her own journey continues to shape her leadership: "Be the doctor you would want for your own family." This principle has kept her grounded and compassionate through the most challenging days, reminding her to communicate clearly, stay present, and care deeply for every patient. Dr. Tom's blend of clinical expertise, cultural richness, and artistic soul represents the multifaceted nature of healers who bring their whole selves to the art of caring for others.

        Meet Dr. Brandon Rockwell, our Chief Resident from Warner Robins, Georgia, who discovered his calling at the intersection of his fascination with the natural world and desire to help others thrive. Internal medicine represents the perfect convergence of intellectual curiosity and meaningful human connection, allowing him to channel his analytical nature into creating positive change in patients' lives.

        An avid sports enthusiast, Dr. Rockwell follows college athletics with passion while staying active through pickleball and regular gym sessions. His love for reading feeds his intellectual appetite, and he's developed a unique hobby of brewing his own kombucha. After demanding shifts, he unwinds with his favorite comfort meal: a hearty steak burrito loaded with queso.

        Dr. Rockwell's professional aspirations center on primary care, where he envisions building lasting relationships with patients and serving as their advocate throughout their healthcare journey. His philosophy for succeeding in residency is refreshingly straightforward: "Trust your gut. Diligence outlasts intelligence and talent." The guidance that has shaped his own path emphasizes embracing challenges: "If deciding between two things, the right answer is likely whichever is more work."

        Interestingly, if medicine hadn't captured his heart, Dr. Rockwell might have found himself in plumbing‚Äîa profession that, like medicine, requires problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the satisfaction of fixing what's broken. His practical mindset and dedication to helping others showcase the versatile spirit he brings to our residency program.

      On Saturday, May 31, we celebrated the graduation of our Class of 2025. As the inaugural Internal Medicine residency class at SGMC Health, Drs. Rija Chaudhary, Venkata Gandi, Monica Kovuri, Dwayne Mohan, Anum Munir, Shilpa Reddy, and Rosaida Silverio-Lopez became the foundation of something extraordinary, proving that when communities invest in the people who serve them, remarkable things happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each graduate brought something unique during their three-year journey, navigating rigorous training while helping build the program that shaped them. Dr. Monica Kovuri's Excellence in Residency Award reflects the compassionate leadership she demonstrated as Chief Resident alongside Dr. Venkata Gandi, mentoring peers with grace and wisdom. Dr. Rosaida Silverio-Lopez's Scholarly Excellence Award highlights her commitment to research and evidence-based medicine, exemplifying the intellectual curiosity that will drive regional medical innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What made this graduation even more meaningful is the knowledge that Drs. Gandi, Silverio-Lopez, and Mohan have chosen to remain and join our GME program as teaching hospitalists. This decision speaks volumes about the residency program. When young physicians choose to stay, they're not just choosing a job‚Äîthey're choosing to be part of something bigger, to plant roots in South Georgia soil and invest their careers in the communities that invested in their training.

    <p>
      Congratulations, and welcome to the next chapter of your remarkable journey in medicine.

  title: Finding Your Footing - A Message to Our Interns
  image: /img/intern-year.jpeg
  author: Samuel Edusa, MD PGY-2
  content: >
    <p>Welcome to the beginning of an extraordinary journey. As you start your year, remember that every expert was once a beginner, and every mentor around you was once exactly where you are today.</p>

    <h3>Learning to Walk Before You Run</h3>

    <p>Medicine is not a sprint‚Äîit's learning to walk before you run. Right now, everything feels overwhelming. Epic seems impossible, lab values blur together, and the responsibility feels immense. This is not just normal; it's necessary. Every uncertain moment, every question you're afraid to ask‚Äîthese aren't signs of inadequacy. They're the building blocks of the physician you're becoming.</p>

    <p>Think of a child learning to walk. They don't start by running. They pull themselves up, take tentative steps, fall, and get back up. Each wobble teaches balance. Each fall builds resilience. Your intern year is your time to find your footing, and we expect you to wobble.</p>

    <h3>The Power of "I Don't Know"</h3>

    <p>One of the hardest lessons: it's okay to say "I don't know." The most dangerous physician isn't the one who lacks knowledge, but the one who pretends to have it. Your uncertainty isn't weakness‚Äîit's wisdom. When you're stumped, when a patient asks something you can't answer, remember that "I don't know, but I'll find out" is one of your most powerful tools.</p>

    <h3>You Are Not Alone</h3>

    <p>Here's what I want you to remember every day: you are surrounded by people invested in your success. Your attendings were once interns who felt exactly as you do. Your senior residents remember their own first days and fears. The nurses have seen countless interns grow into confident physicians.</p>

    <p>We're not here to judge your questions or critique your uncertainties. We're here to guide you through them. When you call at 2 AM with a question, we don't see incompetence‚Äîwe see diligence. When you ask us to double-check your assessment, we don't see insecurity‚Äîwe see responsibility.</p>

    <h3>The Patient at the Center</h3>

    <p>In the midst of learning procedures and protocols, never forget the human being at the center of it all. Your patients don't expect you to have all the answers immediately. They expect you to care, to listen, and to be honest. While this might be your fifth admission of the day, it's their first time being this sick, this scared, this vulnerable.</p>

    <h3>Trust the Process</h3>

    <p>There will be days when nothing goes according to plan, when you feel like you're drowning, when you question your abilities. These difficult days aren't detours from your path‚Äîthey are the path itself. Every challenging case teaches you something new. Every difficult conversation builds your skills. Every long night strengthens your endurance.</p>

    <p>The journey from medical student to competent physician isn't a straight line. It's a spiral where you'll revisit concepts at deeper levels, where complexity gradually becomes manageable. Trust that the process works. Trust that today's confusion will become tomorrow's clarity.</p>

    <h3>Our Promise to You</h3>

    <p>We will be patient with your learning process. We will answer your questions without judgment. We will provide guidance when you're lost and celebrate your victories. We will support you through setbacks and help you find your footing so that one day, you can run with confidence.</p>

    <p>Remember, we were all beginners once. What got us through wasn't perfection‚Äîit was persistence, curiosity, and the support of those around us.</p>

    <h3>Moving Forward</h3>

    <p>Be kind to yourself. Be patient with your learning curve. Ask questions freely. Seek help readily. And never forget that every day you show up, you're making a difference in someone's life.</p>

    <p>You chose medicine to heal, to help, to make a difference. That calling hasn't changed because the learning curve is steep. You are exactly where you need to be, learning exactly what you need to learn, becoming exactly who you need to become.</p>

    <p>Welcome to your intern year. We believe in you. Now it's time to believe in yourself. üí™üèΩ</p>

    <p>In the basement classrooms of SGMC Health, an extraordinary cultural exchange unfolded as medical residents gathered for "Culturosity: Ghana vs. Nigeria," transforming a typical lunch hour into a vibrant celebration of West African heritage. The event, far from being a competition as its playful title might suggest, showcased the rich culinary traditions that bind these two influential African nations.</p>

    <p>The spread was a visual and aromatic testament to the depth of both cultures' cuisines. Traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian dishes filled the serving tables, from aromatic jollof rice displaying its characteristic orange-red hue to tender khebab skewers seasoned with complex spice blends. Plates of grilled chicken, prepared in distinctly different but equally mouthwatering styles, sat alongside pots of rich stews studded with fish and vegetables. The centerpiece was a variety of rice dishes, each telling its own story of regional preferences and cooking techniques.</p>

    </div>

    <p>But this gathering transcended the dining experience, evolving into a masterclass in cultural exchange. The event artfully wove together culinary traditions with deeper insights into West African heritage. While the aromas of spiced dishes filled the air, conversations flowed naturally between residents and students, bridging gaps in cultural understanding. The long-standing playful debate over jollof rice supremacy between Ghana and Nigeria sparked animated discussions, while first-time tastings of traditional dishes created moments of discovery and connection. Through these shared experiences, the medical community demonstrated how food can serve as a powerful catalyst for cultural appreciation and understanding.</p>

As one resident was overheard saying while reaching for seconds, "Understanding each other's cultures makes us better doctors." </p>

  title: "Finding Humor in the Hard Days: A Reminder About Emotional Well-being"
  altImageText: Emotional well-being
  image: /img/emotional-plushie.jpeg
  content: >
    <p>Those charming "Emotional Support" plushies you might have spotted scattered throughout our hospital corridors capture the often-unspoken reality of medical residency perfectly. These whimsical crochet creations, shaped like teacups with wisps of steam rising from their rims, hold a telling message: "It's fine, I'm fine. Everything is fine!"</p>

    <p>While these delightful companions make us smile, they also open an important dialogue about how we, as healthcare professionals, process stress and emotions. It's a gentle reminder that sometimes saying "I'm fine" three times doesn't make it true, and that's okay.</p>

    <p>Remember: Our residency program offers confidential counseling services and peer support groups. Taking care of yourself isn't just fine‚Äîit's essential.</p>
