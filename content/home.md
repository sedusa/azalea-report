    <p>SGMC Health's Graduate Medical Education program announced the appointment of Samuel Edusa, MD and Ornob Rahman, MD as Chief Residents for the Internal Medicine Residency Program beginning in March 2026. Their peers selected them, and faculty approved the appointments.</p>

    <p>During their one-year term, Dr. Edusa and Dr. Rahman will coordinate between residents and faculty, lead educational conferences, manage schedules, supervise trainees, and support resident well-being across both Internal Medicine and Transitional Year programs.</p>

    <p>Dr. Edusa graduated from the University of Ghana Medical School. Dr. Rahman earned his medical degree from the University of Medicine and Health Sciences in St. Kitts.</p>

    <p>"We're excited to have Dr. Edusa and Dr. Rahman leading the program," said Greg Beale, MD, Program Director. "They bring strong clinical skills and a real commitment to education and patient care."</p>

    <p>SGMC Health's Medical Education program is also growing. Beyond Internal Medicine and Transitional Year residencies, a Family Medicine residency program launches in summer 2026. SGMC Health is a clinical campus for Mercer University School of Medicine, where third- and fourth-year medical students complete clinical rotations.</p>

        Meet our Chief Resident, Dr. Mariya Tom, from Atlanta. She grew up watching uncles and aunties work in healthcare, and their stories about patient care are what drew her to medicine.

        Outside the hospital, Dr. Tom is a trained Indian classical dancer who also loves Zumba. She travels when she can, reads when she can't, and recharges in Atlanta with her husband and family. Her comfort food after long shifts? Chicken and rice.

        She's interested in endocrinology and plans to pursue fellowship training before heading back to Atlanta. Her advice to incoming residents: "Give yourself grace. You'll make mistakes. Own them, learn from them, and forgive yourself. Progress, not perfection, is the goal."

        The principle that guides her: "Be the doctor you would want for your own family." It keeps her grounded on the hardest days and reminds her to communicate clearly, stay present, and actually care about every patient.

      content: >
        Meet Dr. Brandon Rockwell, our Chief Resident from Warner Robins, Georgia. He got into internal medicine because he likes figuring things out and he likes people. That's pretty much the job description.

        He follows college athletics closely, plays pickleball, hits the gym, and reads a lot. He also brews his own kombucha, which is either impressive or concerning depending on who you ask. After long shifts, his go-to is a steak burrito loaded with queso.

        Dr. Rockwell plans to go into primary care. He wants to build long-term relationships with patients and actually be their doctor, not just someone they see once. His residency philosophy: "Trust your gut. Diligence outlasts intelligence and talent." And when choosing between two options: "The right answer is probably whichever is more work."

        If medicine hadn't worked out, he says he'd have gone into plumbing. Same idea, really: figure out what's broken, fix it, move on to the next problem.

    <p>SGMC Health was well represented at this year's Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition in Moultrie, Georgia. The Sunbelt Ag Expo bills itself as "North America's Premier Farm Show," and it lives up to it — farmers, educators, policymakers, and ag enthusiasts all in one place, checking out the latest in agricultural technology and watching the Southeastern Farmer of the Year get named.</p>

    <p>Our residents gave health presentations at the expo. Drs. Ledford, Yakubu, Randhawa, and Akram talked to farmers and their families about topics like skin cancer prevention and managing chronic conditions — the kind of practical health information that matters most to people who work outside every day.</p>

    <p>Being at the Sunbelt Ag Expo drives home how closely agriculture and healthcare are connected. Farmers spend long hours in the sun but don't always have easy access to health education. Events like this let us reach people where they already are.</p>

        Born in Cuba with a head for numbers and a green thumb for aquascaping, this future infectious disease specialist has a fascinating side obsession. Finding creative ways to invest and grow wealth. He's laser focused on matching into an Infectious Disease fellowship, though if medicine hadn't panned out, he's convinced coding would've been his calling. Turns out he's got a real talent for building apps and programs that could genuinely make people's lives easier. Software development's loss is infectious disease's gain.
        After brutal hospital shifts, his recharge methods are pretty straightforward. Movies, preferably horror, gore, mystery, or anything that'll make him laugh. Maybe some pickleball if he's feeling active. TV shows though? Dangerous territory. Once he starts, it's full binge mode, so he's strategically avoiding new series for his own protection at this point. His ideal evening off sounds perfect. Hit the movie theater with friends, grab food and drinks after, then cap it all off with competitive card or board games. There's something about that combination of screen time, good food, and friendly competition that just hits different.
        When he really needs to reset, hiking will do. Hand him a trail and point him toward elevation and that's his decompression method. Topics he could discuss endlessly? Finance strategies and wealth management (naturally), the intricacies of aquascaping, and deep dives into Biblical scripture. Fair warning though, his hobbies run deeper. Fishing, gardening, learning to grow his own food. The man's preparing for something.
        Here's the unexpected part. He's got serious craftsmanship skills from years of woodworking and home improvement projects with his father. The kind of hands on expertise where he could legitimately build a small house if needed. He's got that rare spatial awareness where he can visualize the finished product before the first nail gets hammered. Not your typical medical resident skillset, but incredibly practical. 🔨🌱

        Palm Beach, Florida is home now, though she started life in Washington State. This PM&R resident heading to Shands in Gainesville has what most people would call an extreme relationship with physical limits. She competes in Ironman triathlons and doesn't just finish them. She podiums in her age group. Consistently. Her fellowship plans are already mapped out too. Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine with an interventional spine subspecialty track. The kind of career path that makes sense when you spend your free time exploring what happens when the human body gets pushed past comfortable.
        Ask her what she'd be doing if medicine wasn't the plan and the answer comes quick. General contractor. She actually enjoys the physical work, the problem solving, the satisfaction of building and fixing things with her hands. There's a throughline there if you look for it.
        Her version of unwinding after exhausting hospital days? Going for an even longer run than necessary. Most residents would find that absolutely unhinged, but for her it works. She consumes David Goggins content like it's a lifestyle requirement. Athletic performance books, sports inspiration stories, the latest research on human capability. It all feeds the same engine. Her perfect evening off involves completing a full triathlon distance just for fun, then demolishing an enormous Italian meal. The reward has to match the effort.
        What people might not expect is the yoga practice. Deep, committed, avid yoga. She also does modern dance, which creates this fascinating contrast with the Ironman intensity. Both require body awareness but in completely opposite ways. Get her talking about any of it and hours disappear. Triathlon pacing strategies, yoga breathing techniques, contemporary choreography. She moves between all three like they're the same language.
        Then there's the music thing. She sings and can read and write it too. Not exactly what you'd guess about someone whose idea of relaxation is voluntary suffering, but it rounds out the picture. Builder, endurance athlete, movement artist, musician. She's figured out more ways to use a body than most people consider possible. 🎶💪

    <p>SGMC Health earned recognition at the Georgia Hospital Association (GHA) Patient Safety Summit, receiving second and third place Josh Nahum Awards for their Infection Prevention and Control projects.</p>

    <p>The second-place project, "Discharge Antibiotics Optimization for Urinary Tract Infections in Emergency Room Patients," developed an antibiogram to help emergency department physicians select more effective empiric antibiotics for UTI treatment. By analyzing local population data, the team created evidence-based treatment guidelines to reduce ineffective prescriptions.</p>

    <p>The third-place "Antimicrobial Stewardship Team for Better Clinical Outcomes" project focuses on optimizing antimicrobial use. The team meets quarterly to evaluate prescription practices, ensuring appropriate medication selection, dosing, and treatment duration while minimizing side effects. These efforts improve patient outcomes, prevent drug resistance, and reduce costs.</p>

  title: A Mid-Year Reflection for Our Interns
  image: /img/intern-mid-year.jpeg
  author: Samuel Edusa, MD PGY-2
  content: >
    <p>Look how far you've come.</p>

    <p>Four months ago, I wrote about finding your footing. The wobbles, the falls, the slow process of figuring out how to stand on your own. Now I'm writing because you've made real progress, and I want to talk about what comes next: the mid-year stretch, where the early excitement has worn off but the end still feels far away.</p>

    <h3>You've come a long way</h3>

    <p>Epic used to feel impossible. Now you move through it without thinking. Lab values that once sent you scrambling are starting to form patterns. Admissions that used to take everything out of you? You're handling multiple complex patients now.</p>

    <p>That matters. And the fact that you can see what you still don't know means you know a lot more than you did in July.</p>

    <h3>The mid-year slump is real</h3>

    <p>You're probably tired in a different way than before. The adrenaline is gone. The novelty wore off. You know enough to see how much is left to learn, but you haven't been at it long enough to feel like you've mastered anything.</p>

    <p>That in-between space is uncomfortable. Imposter syndrome gets louder here. The fatigue feels more permanent. I want you to know: this is normal. Being in the middle doesn't mean you're falling behind. It means you're in it.</p>

    <h3>Think back to July</h3>

    <p>Remember needing help with every note? Hesitating before calling an attending? Second-guessing every decision? You still have those moments, but they're fewer now. You write notes faster. You make calls with more confidence. You know when to ask for help and when you can handle it.</p>

    <p>You've managed codes. You've delivered bad news. You've stayed calm when things got chaotic. Patients ask for you by name. Nurses trust you. That's not nothing.</p>

    <h3>What the next eight months look like</h3>

    <p>You're not starting over. You're building on what you've already learned. Each rotation deepens your knowledge. Each complex case connects to something you saw months ago. That patient with the weird presentation? You'll remember a similar one from September. That drug interaction? It'll click because you learned about it in November. The knowledge adds up.</p>

    <h3>Take care of yourself</h3>

    <p>Four months of long hours and emotional weight takes a toll. You need your days off. Read the book you've been putting off. See the friend you keep meaning to call. Pick up the hobby you dropped. You're at the halfway point of a long year, and you need to pace yourself to finish it.</p>

    <h3>Keep asking questions</h3>

    <p>Don't let growing confidence make you stop asking. The best residents don't stop asking questions; they start asking better ones. Move from "What do I do?" to "Why do we do it this way?" From "Is this right?" to "What if we tried this instead?"</p>

    <h3>You're not alone in this</h3>

    <p>Look around. Your classmates have grown too. They're feeling the same weight and seeing the same progress. Lean on each other. Celebrate wins together. Get through the hard shifts together.</p>

    <h3>Eight months left</h3>

    <p>That's enough time to solidify what you've learned and build the confidence you'll carry into PGY-2. And when July comes, you'll realize intern year was just the beginning. There's a lot more ahead.</p>

    <h3>We're still here</h3>

    <p>The support hasn't changed because you've grown. We're still here to answer questions, celebrate your wins, and back you up. You've proven you can do hard things. You've earned your place.</p>

    <p>Keep going. You've got this. 💪🏽</p>

    <p>For this Culturosity session, residents Michael Heron, MD and Patrick Joseph, MD cooked up a Caribbean feast. Dr. Heron made Jamaican oxtail (fall-off-the-bone tender), rice and peas, steamed cabbage, and fried plantains. Dr. Joseph brought Haitian rice and chicken that had people going back for seconds. Between plates, both talked about where they grew up, family food traditions, and what these dishes mean back home. There's something about cooking for people that turns a work gathering into something more personal.</p>

    <p>As the Jamaican saying goes, "One one coco full basket," and the Haitian proverb puts it, "Men anpil, chay pa lou" (Many hands make the load lighter). One resident, going back for another plate, said it well: "When we understand where each other comes from, it makes us better at taking care of our patients."</p>

    title: Practice Manager
    profile: >
      Felicia Farrell has been our Practice Manager for eleven years. She works closely with providers and nurses to keep the practice running smoothly, handling everything from compliance to budgets. What she likes most about the job is the teamwork. She says the best part is knowing that the administrative work she does directly affects patient care. Outside of work, family time keeps her grounded. When asked what makes her proud to work here, she points to the team culture and the focus on patient care. People who work with Felicia know she's a creative problem-solver, the kind of person who finds a way to make things work when the obvious solution doesn't.

  altImageText: Emotional well-being
  image: /img/emotional-plushie.jpeg
  content: >
    <p>You might have noticed those little crochet "Emotional Support" plushies around the hospital. They're shaped like teacups with steam rising off the top, and they say: "It's fine, I'm fine. Everything is fine!"</p>

    <p>They're funny, but they also get at something real. Saying "I'm fine" on repeat doesn't actually make it true. Residency is hard, and how we handle stress matters.</p>

    <p>Our program offers confidential counseling and peer support groups. Use them. Taking care of yourself isn't optional.</p>
