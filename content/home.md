    The PAR tribal system aims to act as a liaison between residents and GME focusing on resident wellness, building camaraderie and improving the resident experience. The PAR resident body recently voted for Dr Ghida Akdhar as the new Vice President, with Dr Danhely Cruz continuing on as our president. We thank Dr Sheri Walls for all her hardwork and dedication in advocating for the resident body and improving the resident experience. 

    Dr Akdhar, a Lebanese national who studied medicine at The Universite Saint Joseph in Lebanon, is excited for her new role and is committed to the continued improvement of resident well-being. "I was always drawn to extracurricular activities where I can voice my opinion, advocate for change and develop my leadership skills. I don't believe that we have to be in any titled position to have a leading role in change, but I did want to be held accountable for my work, and that's why I decided to run for a leadership position in the Tribal Council. I really believe we can shape residency into what it's supposed to be, an enjoyable training experience that does not come at the cost of our well-being."

    <p>As November looms ahead, the intern is four months into their residency, a fledgling, who can now retrospectively analyze and reminisce the bygone days from medical school while simultaneously establishing their identity as a physician. November also means interview season is once again overhead however, it feels strange observing from the other side. There is a sense of relief that washes over one to know the tumultuous journey of participating in the Match is behind you. Unless that is, the journey as a physician-in-training in the residency life cycle is just beginning and there are thoughts about fellowship. The prospect of this exciting venture will be discussed later.</p>
    <p>It is hard to escape the excitement of graduating from school and entering the real world. The longer white coat symbolizes stepping into the new milestone. Excitement is shared with your current peers and senior residents who you will continue to bond with over the next few years and spend more time with than family and friends. Bright-eyed and bursting with the energy to tackle this new conquest and step closer to their goals, the newly-minted intern heads into the yet hidden chaos of intern year.</p>
    <p>The bustle and hum of a community hospital encompasses the intern as they step into the fluorescent lights, blinking, and fluttering with intermittent palpitations as they succumb to the reality of their responsibility and the confusion of navigating a maze of unfamiliar hallways. In the resident conference room, they are greeted by Dr. B, the program director who reassures the nervous interns as they head to their first rotations. The intern dives in wholly unaware of the challenging road ahead. Patients, medications, and early hours amalgamate in a caffeinated haze.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the intern's resilience propels them forward; four months have flown by before they know it. Medicine is a mosaic of physiological intricacies intertwined with pathology further colored by the psyche of human nature. Though it never gets easy, there is a certain fulfillment in this career within which one holds the ability to reduce human suffering. So continue to forge ahead little intern. The mistakes, errors, and indecision will lessen as you cement your growing foundation and build your way to attendinghood.</p>

  title: Addressing Farmer Health at the 46th Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition

    <p>As a healthcare professional, I, together with a few colleagues, recently had the privilege of volunteering and presenting short talks on pertinent health topics at the 46th Annual Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition in Moultrie, Georgia. This event, held from October 15–17, 2024, at Spence Field, is truly a spectacle to behold — rightfully crowned as "North America's Premier Farm Show."</p>
    
    <p>The Sunbelt Ag Expo is a massive undertaking, spanning 93 acres and featuring over 850 exhibitors. It’s a melting pot of farmers, educators, policymakers, and ag-enthusiasts, all gathered to witness the latest innovations in agriculture. From cutting-edge technology demonstrations to the naming of the Southeastern Farmer of the Year, the expo is a celebration of all things agriculture.</p>

    <p>This year, the expo partnered with the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) South Georgia to introduce a groundbreaking healthcare exhibit. As part of this initiative, I, along with Dr. Tom and Dr. Silverio-Lopez, presented respectively on skin cancer, complications of diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease prevention.</p>

    <p>Participating in the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition was an eye-opening experience. It highlighted the intricate connection between agriculture and healthcare, particularly in areas like skin cancer prevention for farmers. Events like these provide a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between these two vital sectors, ensuring that those who feed the world are also taking care of their health.</p>
