    <p>SGMC Health's Graduate Medical Education program announced the appointment of Samuel Edusa, MD and Ornob Rahman, MD as Chief Residents for the Internal Medicine Residency Program beginning in March 2026. Selected by their peers and approved by faculty, both physicians were recognized for exceptional leadership, professionalism, and clinical excellence.</p>

    <p>During their one-year term, Dr. Edusa and Dr. Rahman will serve as liaisons between residents and faculty, lead educational conferences, coordinate schedules, supervise trainees, and champion resident well-being while overseeing both Internal Medicine and Transitional Year residents.</p>

    <p>Dr. Edusa graduated from the University of Ghana Medical School, where he developed a reputation for clinical excellence and compassionate mentorship. Dr. Rahman earned his medical degree from the University of Medicine and Health Sciences in St. Kitts.</p>

    <p>"Dr. Edusa and Dr. Rahman represent the future of medicine," said Greg Beale, MD, Program Director of the Internal Medicine Residency Program. "Their dedication to education and patient care will strengthen our residency program and inspire the next generation of physicians."</p>

    <p>SGMC Health's Medical Education program continues to expand. In addition to Internal Medicine and Transitional Year residencies, the system will launch a Family Medicine residency program in summer 2026.

        Meet our Chief Resident, Dr. Mariya Tom, who brings the heart of Atlanta and a dancer's grace to our program. Her journey into medicine began with family—uncles and aunties whose tireless work in healthcare shaped her understanding of what it truly means to be a physician. Their stories of patient care and the fulfillment found in saving lives became the foundation of her medical calling.

        A trained professional Indian classical dancer with a passion for Zumba, Dr. Tom embodies the balance between artistic expression and clinical excellence. When she's not in the hospital, you'll find her traveling, reading, or back home in Atlanta with her husband and family, often recharging with her go-to comfort food of chicken and rice after long shifts.

        Dr. Tom's clinical interests center on endocrinology, with post-residency plans including fellowship training before returning to Atlanta to build both her practice and family life. Her guidance to incoming residents reflects hard-earned wisdom: "Give yourself grace. You'll make mistakes. Own them, learn from them, and forgive yourself. Progress, not perfection, is the goal."

        The advice that has anchored her own journey continues to shape her leadership: "Be the doctor you would want for your own family." This principle has kept her grounded and compassionate through the most challenging days, reminding her to communicate clearly, stay present, and care deeply for every patient. Dr. Tom's blend of clinical expertise, cultural richness, and artistic soul represents the multifaceted nature of healers who bring their whole selves to the art of caring for others.
    - name: Brandon Rockwell, MD

        Meet Dr. Brandon Rockwell, our Chief Resident from Warner Robins, Georgia, who discovered his calling at the intersection of his fascination with the natural world and desire to help others thrive. Internal medicine represents the perfect convergence of intellectual curiosity and meaningful human connection, allowing him to channel his analytical nature into creating positive change in patients' lives.

        An avid sports enthusiast, Dr. Rockwell follows college athletics with passion while staying active through pickleball and regular gym sessions. His love for reading feeds his intellectual appetite, and he's developed a unique hobby of brewing his own kombucha. After demanding shifts, he unwinds with his favorite comfort meal: a hearty steak burrito loaded with queso.

        Dr. Rockwell's professional aspirations center on primary care, where he envisions building lasting relationships with patients and serving as their advocate throughout their healthcare journey. His philosophy for succeeding in residency is refreshingly straightforward: "Trust your gut. Diligence outlasts intelligence and talent." The guidance that has shaped his own path emphasizes embracing challenges: "If deciding between two things, the right answer is likely whichever is more work."

        Interestingly, if medicine hadn't captured his heart, Dr. Rockwell might have found himself in plumbing—a profession that, like medicine, requires problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the satisfaction of fixing what's broken. His practical mindset and dedication to helping others showcase the versatile spirit he brings to our residency program.

    <p>This year, SGMC Health had excellent representation at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition in Moultrie, Georgia. The Sunbelt Ag Expo is truly a spectacle to behold — rightfully crowned as "North America's Premier Farm Show." It's a melting pot of farmers, educators, policymakers, and ag-enthusiasts, all gathered to witness the latest innovations in agriculture. From cutting-edge technology demonstrations to the naming of the Southeastern Farmer of the Year, the expo is a celebration of all things agriculture.</p>
    
    <p>As part of the healthcare initiatives at this year's expo, SGMC Health residents delivered presentations on pertinent health topics. Drs. Ledford, Yakubu, Randhawa, and Akram represented our program, sharing their expertise with the agricultural community and contributing to the important work of bringing healthcare education to farmers and their families.</p>

        Born in Cuba with a head for numbers and a green thumb for aquascaping, this future infectious disease specialist has a fascinating side obsession. Finding creative ways to invest and grow wealth. He's laser focused on matching into an Infectious Disease fellowship, though if medicine hadn't panned out, he's convinced coding would've been his calling. Turns out he's got a real talent for building apps and programs that could genuinely make people's lives easier. Software development's loss is infectious disease's gain.
        After brutal hospital shifts, his recharge methods are pretty straightforward. Movies, preferably horror, gore, mystery, or anything that'll make him laugh. Maybe some pickleball if he's feeling active. TV shows though? Dangerous territory. Once he starts, it's full binge mode, so he's strategically avoiding new series for his own protection at this point. His ideal evening off sounds perfect. Hit the movie theater with friends, grab food and drinks after, then cap it all off with competitive card or board games. There's something about that combination of screen time, good food, and friendly competition that just hits different.
        When he really needs to reset, hiking will do. Hand him a trail and point him toward elevation and that's his decompression method. Topics he could discuss endlessly? Finance strategies and wealth management (naturally), the intricacies of aquascaping, and deep dives into Biblical scripture. Fair warning though, his hobbies run deeper. Fishing, gardening, learning to grow his own food. The man's preparing for something.
        Here's the unexpected part. He's got serious craftsmanship skills from years of woodworking and home improvement projects with his father. The kind of hands on expertise where he could legitimately build a small house if needed. He's got that rare spatial awareness where he can visualize the finished product before the first nail gets hammered. Not your typical medical resident skillset, but incredibly practical. 🔨🌱

        Palm Beach, Florida is home now, though she started life in Washington State. This PM&R resident heading to Shands in Gainesville has what most people would call an extreme relationship with physical limits. She competes in Ironman triathlons and doesn't just finish them. She podiums in her age group. Consistently. Her fellowship plans are already mapped out too. Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine with an interventional spine subspecialty track. The kind of career path that makes sense when you spend your free time exploring what happens when the human body gets pushed past comfortable.
        Ask her what she'd be doing if medicine wasn't the plan and the answer comes quick. General contractor. She actually enjoys the physical work, the problem solving, the satisfaction of building and fixing things with her hands. There's a throughline there if you look for it.
        Her version of unwinding after exhausting hospital days? Going for an even longer run than necessary. Most residents would find that absolutely unhinged, but for her it works. She consumes David Goggins content like it's a lifestyle requirement. Athletic performance books, sports inspiration stories, the latest research on human capability. It all feeds the same engine. Her perfect evening off involves completing a full triathlon distance just for fun, then demolishing an enormous Italian meal. The reward has to match the effort.
        What people might not expect is the yoga practice. Deep, committed, avid yoga. She also does modern dance, which creates this fascinating contrast with the Ironman intensity. Both require body awareness but in completely opposite ways. Get her talking about any of it and hours disappear. Triathlon pacing strategies, yoga breathing techniques, contemporary choreography. She moves between all three like they're the same language.
        Then there's the music thing. She sings and can read and write it too. Not exactly what you'd guess about someone whose idea of relaxation is voluntary suffering, but it rounds out the picture. Builder, endurance athlete, movement artist, musician. She's figured out more ways to use a body than most people consider possible. 🎶💪

  title: A Mid-Year Reflection for Our Interns
  image: /img/intern-mid-year.jpeg
  author: Samuel Edusa, MD PGY-2
  content: >
    <p>Look how far you've come.</p>

    <p>Four months ago, I wrote to you about finding your footing—about those tentative first steps, the wobbles, and the falls that would teach you balance. Today, I'm writing to celebrate the progress you've made and to help you navigate what many call "intern winter" — that challenging middle stretch where the initial excitement has faded, but the finish line still feels distant.</p>

    <h3>You're No Longer Walking — You're Stepping Forward</h3>

    <p>Remember when Epic seemed like an impossible maze? Now you navigate it with muscle memory. Remember when every lab value required frantic Googling? Now you're recognizing patterns. Remember when a simple admission felt overwhelming? Now you're managing multiple complex patients with growing confidence.</p>

    <p>These aren't small victories — they're monumental shifts. The fact that you're aware of what you don't know shows you know enough to recognize the gaps. That's progress, not failure.</p>

    <h3>The Mid-Year Slump Is Real—And Normal</h3>

    <p>Right now, you might be feeling tired in a way that's different from those first exhausting months. The novelty has worn off. The adrenaline that fueled your early days has settled. You're deep enough to see how much you still don't know, but not far enough to feel like you've truly mastered anything.</p>

    <p>This is the hardest part—the middle ground between "I have no idea what I'm doing" and "I've got this." It's the place where imposter syndrome whispers loudest, where fatigue feels permanent, and where the path ahead still seems long.</p>

    <p>I want you to know: this is exactly where you're supposed to be. The mid-year slump doesn't mean you're failing. It means you're growing.</p>

    <h3>Reflecting on Your Growth</h3>

    <p>Think back to July. Remember that intern who needed help with every note, who hesitated before calling an attending, who second-guessed every decision? That person is still you, but transformed. You write notes faster now. You make clinical decisions with more confidence. You've learned when to call for help and when you can handle it yourself.</p>

    <p>You've helped manage codes. You've broken bad news. You've stayed calm when everything felt chaotic. You've built relationships with patients who now ask for you by name. You've earned the trust of nurses who've seen you grow. These aren't small accomplishments—they're evidence that you're becoming the physician you set out to be.</p>

    <h3>Building on Your Foundation</h3>

    <p>The remaining months aren't about starting over—they're about building. You've laid the foundation. Now it's time to construct the framework. Every rotation becomes an opportunity to deepen your knowledge. Every complex case becomes a chance to integrate what you've learned.</p>

    <p>This is when you'll start to see connections you missed before. That patient with the strange presentation? You'll remember a similar case from September. That medication interaction? You'll recall learning about it in November. The knowledge is stacking, compounding, becoming part of your clinical intuition.</p>

    <h3>Managing the Fatigue</h3>

    <p>Let's talk about the exhaustion. It's real. Four months of long hours, emotional weight, and constant learning takes a toll. Sustainable medicine isn't about never being tired—it's about recognizing when you need rest and giving yourself permission to take it.</p>

    <p>Your days off aren't optional extras—they're essential maintenance. That book you've been meaning to read? Read it. That friend you haven't seen? See them. That hobby you've abandoned? Pick it back up. Medicine is a marathon, and you're only at the halfway point. You need to pace yourself.</p>

    <h3>Questions Are Still Your Superpower</h3>

    <p>Don't let mid-year confidence make you hesitant to ask questions. The best residents aren't those who stop asking—they're those who ask better questions. As you grow, your inquiries should evolve from "What do I do?" to "Why do we do it this way?" from "Is this right?" to "What if we tried this?"</p>

    <p>Curiosity isn't a sign of weakness—it's the engine of expertise. Keep questioning. Keep learning. Keep that beginner's mind that makes every case a teaching opportunity.</p>

    <h3>You're Not Just Surviving—You're Thriving</h3>

    <p>We see you now: managing your list with efficiency, teaching medical students, supporting each other through difficult shifts. You're not just surviving intern year—you're actively shaping it into a transformative experience.</p>

    <p>Look around at your classmates. They've grown too. You're not the only one feeling the weight and seeing the progress. Lean on each other. Celebrate each other's wins. Support each other through the hard days. This journey is individual, but you don't have to walk it alone.</p>

    <h3>The Finish Line Is Closer Than It Feels</h3>

    <p>Eight months remain. Eight months to solidify everything you've learned. Eight months to build the confidence that will carry you into PGY-2. Eight months to finish what you started.</p>

    <p>But here's the thing—this isn't really about finishing. It's about continuing. Because when July comes and you become PGY-2s, you'll realize that intern year was just the first chapter. There's so much more learning ahead, more challenges to embrace, more growth to experience.</p>

    <h3>Our Continued Commitment</h3>

    <p>We're still here for you. The support hasn't changed just because you've grown. We're still celebrating your victories. We're still here to answer your questions. We're still invested in your success, now more than ever, because we've seen how much you've already achieved.</p>

    <p>As you enter the second half, remember: you've proven you can do hard things. You've shown resilience, dedication, and growth. You've earned your place here.</p>

    <h3>Moving Forward Together</h3>

    <p>So keep stepping forward. Keep asking questions. Keep learning. Keep caring. And most importantly, keep believing in the physician you're becoming—because we believe in you.</p>

    <p>You've made it almost halfway. You've got this. Now let's finish strong. 💪🏽</p>

  content: >
    <p>In the basement classrooms of SGMC Health, an extraordinary cultural exchange unfolded as medical residents gathered for "Culturosity: Ghana vs. Nigeria," transforming a typical lunch hour into a vibrant celebration of West African heritage. The event, far from being a competition as its playful title might suggest, showcased the rich culinary traditions that bind these two influential African nations.</p>

    <p>The spread was a visual and aromatic testament to the depth of both cultures' cuisines. Traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian dishes filled the serving tables, from aromatic jollof rice displaying its characteristic orange-red hue to tender khebab skewers seasoned with complex spice blends. Plates of grilled chicken, prepared in distinctly different but equally mouthwatering styles, sat alongside pots of rich stews studded with fish and vegetables. The centerpiece was a variety of rice dishes, each telling its own story of regional preferences and cooking techniques.</p>

    <p>But this gathering transcended the dining experience, evolving into a masterclass in cultural exchange. The event artfully wove together culinary traditions with deeper insights into West African heritage. While the aromas of spiced dishes filled the air, conversations flowed naturally between residents and students, bridging gaps in cultural understanding. The long-standing playful debate over jollof rice supremacy between Ghana and Nigeria sparked animated discussions, while first-time tastings of traditional dishes created moments of discovery and connection. Through these shared experiences, the medical community demonstrated how food can serve as a powerful catalyst for cultural appreciation and understanding.</p>

    <p>The event exemplified how food serves as a universal language, breaking down barriers and fostering genuine connections that transcend professional and cultural boundaries. As one resident was overheard saying while reaching for seconds, "Understanding each other's cultures makes us better doctors." </p>

  altImageText: Emotional well-being
  image: /img/emotional-plushie.jpeg
  content: >
    <p>Those charming "Emotional Support" plushies you might have spotted scattered throughout our hospital corridors capture the often-unspoken reality of medical residency perfectly. These whimsical crochet creations, shaped like teacups with wisps of steam rising from their rims, hold a telling message: "It's fine, I'm fine. Everything is fine!"</p>

    <p>While these delightful companions make us smile, they also open an important dialogue about how we, as healthcare professionals, process stress and emotions. It's a gentle reminder that sometimes saying "I'm fine" three times doesn't make it true, and that's okay.</p>

    <p>Remember: Our residency program offers confidential counseling services and peer support groups. Taking care of yourself isn't just fine—it's essential.</p>
