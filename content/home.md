    <p>SGMC Health earned recognition at the Georgia Hospital Association (GHA) Patient Safety Summit, receiving second and third place Josh Nahum Awards for their Infection Prevention and Control projects.</p>

    <p>The second-place project, "Discharge Antibiotics Optimization for Urinary Tract Infections in Emergency Room Patients," developed an antibiogram to help emergency department physicians select more effective empiric antibiotics for UTI treatment. By analyzing local population data, the team created evidence-based treatment guidelines to reduce ineffective prescriptions.</p>

    <p>The third-place "Antimicrobial Stewardship Team for Better Clinical Outcomes" project focuses on optimizing antimicrobial use. The team meets quarterly to evaluate prescription practices, ensuring appropriate medication selection, dosing, and treatment duration while minimizing side effects. These efforts improve patient outcomes, prevent drug resistance, and reduce costs.</p>

  author: Hala Sharma, MD PGY-2
  content: >
    <p>Amidst the hustle and bustle of residency, never-ending labs, vitals, nursing requests, seminars, and lengthy note-writing, the bigger picture may become obscured. The why can fall to the wayside while working through the details and minutiae. My most important realization during my intern year while learning what to do was remembering why I was doing it. I wanted to learn and become more efficient and interpreting labs, remembering medications, and improving my presentations during rounds. Yet, some moments would ground and swing me back to reality.</p>

    <p>I would walk into the room of my patient and see the scared, confused pained look in their eyes as they tried to observe the myriad of medical information hurtling their way. Their lives were about to change or transform before my eyes. In times like this, I needed to stop and take a breath as well. This was my eighth patient, but it was their whole world. I would need to remind myself to sit down and give this person, who has a whole life outside of this room, the moment they needed to understand and tell me how they felt. They needed to be heard. Sometimes I felt helpless and confused because I did not have many of the answers to their questions immediately. Or perhaps at other moments, I lacked the confidence to clarify their confusion. This would become my splash of cold-water clarity that there was a human life sitting before me. This was not a textbook module or an exam question I could repeat if I was wrong. Thankfully, I observed humanistic qualities among my peers and sought advice from great mentors. I recalled times when I was the person sitting on the bed waiting for a doctor to come by to answer all my questions and reassure me from my fears. The waiting is painful and terrifying when sick and in pain. There is the hope that this suffering will be temporary and will end. This requires trust in those caring for you. In my day, this may mean spending an extra ten minutes in a patient room talking with them but for them, it will shape the rest of their day.</p>

    <p>Another important realization that washed over me was how much of a team effort it is to care for a patient. So many cogs are required to run this machine, which becomes painfully noticeable when one is not working. The nucleus of each is the patient. This line of work requires a lot of patience and emotional maturity. Learning this is an integral part of our training. It is not necessarily perfection that is the goal of medicine but the ability to learn and adapt. At the heart of the matter is kindness and empathy for the suffering and patience when it may be the hardest to give.</p>

  content: >
    <p>In the basement classrooms of SGMC Health, an extraordinary cultural exchange unfolded as medical residents gathered for "Culturosity: Ghana vs. Nigeria," transforming a typical lunch hour into a vibrant celebration of West African heritage. The event, far from being a competition as its playful title might suggest, showcased the rich culinary traditions that bind these two influential African nations.</p>

    <p>The spread was a visual and aromatic testament to the depth of both cultures' cuisines. Traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian dishes filled the serving tables, from aromatic jollof rice displaying its characteristic orange-red hue to tender khebab skewers seasoned with complex spice blends. Plates of grilled chicken, prepared in distinctly different but equally mouthwatering styles, sat alongside pots of rich stews studded with fish and vegetables. The centerpiece was a variety of rice dishes, each telling its own story of regional preferences and cooking techniques.</p>

    </div>

    <p>But this gathering transcended the dining experience, evolving into a masterclass in cultural exchange. The event artfully wove together culinary traditions with deeper insights into West African heritage. While the aromas of spiced dishes filled the air, conversations flowed naturally between residents and students, bridging gaps in cultural understanding. The long-standing playful debate over jollof rice supremacy between Ghana and Nigeria sparked animated discussions, while first-time tastings of traditional dishes created moments of discovery and connection. Through these shared experiences, the medical community demonstrated how food can serve as a powerful catalyst for cultural appreciation and understanding.</p>

As one resident was overheard saying while reaching for seconds, "Understanding each other's cultures makes us better doctors." </p>

    <p>Those charming "Emotional Support" plushies you might have spotted scattered throughout our hospital corridors capture the often-unspoken reality of medical residency perfectly. These whimsical crochet creations, shaped like teacups with wisps of steam rising from their rims, hold a telling message: "It's fine, I'm fine. Everything is fine!"</p>

    <p>While these delightful companions make us smile, they also open an important dialogue about how we, as healthcare professionals, process stress and emotions. It's a gentle reminder that sometimes saying "I'm fine" three times doesn't make it true, and that's okay.</p>

    <p>Remember: Our residency program offers confidential counseling services and peer support groups. Taking care of yourself isn't just fine‚Äîit's essential.</p>
