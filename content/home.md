date: September 2024
welcome: Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Azalea Report, a resident-led e-newsletter for our Internal Medicine Residency program at South Georgia Medical Center in Valdosta, Georgia. We chose the name "Azalea Report" to honor Valdosta's nickname as the "Azalea City," reflecting our aim to flourish and showcase the best of our program, much like the vibrant azaleas that bloom across our city each spring. In this first edition, we're excited to introduce our editorial team, spotlight outstanding residents, share program achievements, and hear from our newly appointed Chief Residents about their plans for the coming year. We'll also feature a section on community engagement, highlighting how our residents contribute to Valdosta and surrounding areas. Whether you're a current resident, faculty member, prospective applicant, or simply interested in our program, we invite you to explore the Azalea Report and join us on this exciting journey of growth and excellence in medical education.

    The PAR tribal system aims to act as a liaison between residents and GME focusing on resident wellness, building camaraderie and improving the resident experience. The PAR resident body recently voted for Dr Ghida Akdhar as the new Vice President, with Dr Danhely Cruz continuing on as our president. We thank Dr Sheri Walls for all her hardwork and dedication in advocating for the resident body and improving the resident experience. 

    Dr Akdhar, a Lebanese national who studied medicine at The Universite Saint Joseph in Lebanon, is excited for her new role and is committed to the continued improvement of resident well-being. "I was always drawn to extracurricular activities where I can voice my opinion, advocate for change and develop my leadership skills. I don't believe that we have to be in any titled position to have a leading role in change, but I did want to be held accountable for my work, and that's why I decided to run for a leadership position in the Tribal Council. I really believe we can shape residency into what it's supposed to be, an enjoyable training experience that does not come at the cost of our well-being."

    Academic year 2022-2023 has not only seen the graduating class of 2022 leave us to start their new professional lives as attendings but we have also lost faculty and administrative staff. Esteemed Associate Program Director, Dr Nedsley Vila left PAR GME after 6 years of service. Dr Vila sat down with The Residency Reader and shared some important lessons learned during her time with PAR. "I learned the value of building close relationships and that the key to building trust and respect was through empathy, active listening, and providing the support and guidance you needed to succeed."

    Asked about the advice she would give to the residents as they progress through the program, she said this: "My advice is to never forget to put everything in perspective! You are all so incredible and have worked so hard to be where you are. There is a reason for every stage of life and while I know residency is hard, I hope you can focus on all of the positives and make the most of the friendships because it will pass before you know it."

    "What I'll miss most is the satisfaction of seeing my residents grow and develop into skilled, compassionate doctors who I am proud to call my family." We asked Dr Vila what advice she would give to the current residents to ensure their success in the field of medicine: "Approach your work with empathy, kindness, and a willingness to learn and grow. Treat your patients and colleagues as if they were your own family. By modeling empathy, active listening, and a commitment to ongoing learning and growth, I hope to have inspired my residents to become skilled and compassionate doctors who will in turn leave their own positive impact on the lives of their patients and colleagues." 

    Another member of the PAR family who flew the nest is Rachel Hatton, a GME Administrator who has moved on to clinical management consulting/recruitment. "I will miss being able to watch the growth that every resident makes from the time they arrive until graduation. It's so special to see the confidence and accomplishments that you achieve in just 3 short years."
